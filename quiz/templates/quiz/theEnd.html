        That's the end of this experiment.

        <strong>Please wrap up quietly: others may still be answering questions.</strong> We will pay you off in the little room behind
        the glass windows -- please make your way there. If others are already waiting please form a queue.

        It will take us a few minutes to get everybodyâ€™s payments ready; bear with us as we are paying your
        fellow participants. We will do our best to be with you as quickly as we can.

    </p>
    <p>
        After you receive your payoff, please sign the receipt form and hand it over to one of
            the lab assistants.

        <strong>Thanks again for coming along! Your participation makes social science research
        at Essex possible.</strong>
