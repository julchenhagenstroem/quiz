    <p>
        How much you make on this quiz depends on your own performance, but also on your groupâ€™s performance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your payoffs from the quiz are calculated as follows:
        Each correct answer is worth {{ Constants.stakes }}. Everybody on your team will keep half of what they earn
        for themselves. The other half will be put into a pot and will be evenly divided between all
        team members. In mathematical terms:
    </p>
    <p>
        Your payoff = (0.5 * number of questions <strong>you</strong> answered correctly) +
        (0.5 * total number of questions <strong> your team</strong> answered correctly / number of people on your team).
    </p>

    <p>
        Note, though, that we have a {{ Constants.minimum_payoff }} minimum payment policy at ESSEXLab.
        You will be paid {{ Constants.minimum_payoff }} even if your payoff as determined by this quiz is below
        this minimum payment.

    </p>

    <p>
        That means that you can make between {{ Constants.minimum_payoff }}
        (if neither you nor anybody else on your team answers any questions correctly) and
        {{ Constants.maximum_payoff }} (if everybody on your team answers all questions correctly).
