    <p>
        Payoffs are calculated as follows: Each team member keeps half of their earnings, and contributes the
        other half of their earnings into a pot, which is evenly divided among all team members.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is how both teams did:
    </p>

    <table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Team</th>
        <th># Team Members</th>
        <th>% Questions Correct</th>
        <th>Team's pot / # members</th>
        <th>Average Payoff</th>
     </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>A</td>
        <td>{{ n_team_a_consented }} team members</td>
        <td>{{ team_a_avg_is_correct }}%</td>
        <td>{{ team_a_add_on }}</td>
        <td>{{ team_a_avg_payoff }}</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>{{ n_team_b_consented }} team members</td>
        <td>{{ team_b_avg_is_correct }}%</td>
        <td>{{ team_b_add_on }}</td>
        <td>{{ team_b_avg_payoff }}</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    </p>


    <p>
        <strong>Your Payoff</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        You answered {{ is_correct_total }} out of {{ Constants.num_rounds }} questions correctly.
        That means that you have earned {{ earned_total }}.
        Half of these earnings (i.e. {{ half_own_earnings }}) are yours, the other half have been transferred
        to your team's pot. As a member of Team {{ treatment }} you have received
        {% if player.treatment == 'A' %} {{ team_a_add_on }} {% else %} {{ team_b_add_on }} {% endif %}
        out of this pot. Therefore, your total payoff for this game is <strong> {{ payoff }}.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        (Note that if your payoff is less than the {{ Constants.minimum_payoff }} minimum payoff you will
        be paid {{ Constants.minimum_payoff }}).
